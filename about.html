<h1>About Us!</h1>
<p>
  My name is Patrick McAfee and my wife Jessica, just recently started this journey after being in production welding for the last 10 years. We also have two beautiful little girls. My parents owned their own remodeling business and I worked for them from 12-19 years old. McAfee Remodeling & Welding Services is a leading Remodeling Contractor in the East Tennessee area.
I provide my clients with a comprehensive approach to contracting and specialize in a wide range of services.
Since I started out, I’ve been committed to my clients’ needs and satisfaction.
